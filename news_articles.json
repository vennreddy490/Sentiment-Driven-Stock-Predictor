            "articleText": "TeamViewer adopts Almer AR headsets to take remote support from desktop to reality \n Augmented reality startup Almer launches latest headset Arc 2 as it strikes partnership with TeamViewer to scale and offer TeamViewer unique opportunity to support an untapped industrial market. \n \n\n News Direct \n\n \n\n \n --News Direct-- The popular global leader in remote IT support  TeamViewer  has signaled its shift to augmented reality (AR) having struck a strategic partnership with  AR startup Almer . This news comes hot on the heels of Apple\u2019s entry into the AR market with the launch of their Vision Pro headset next month.  The  Almer Arc headset  enables collaboration with remote individuals as if they were physically present and augmentation of the wearer's environment with relevant information for pointing out objects in reality. Almer is also announcing the launch of Arc 2, it\u2019s latest headset which features a 25MP camera, beamforming microphones, built-in speakers, and a holographic see-through screen with 8-hours battery life. As opposed to Apple\u2019s Vision Pro, the Almer Arc 2 is a mere 138 grams, 4 times lighter. Thanks to the completely transparent display of the Arc 2, it can be employed in mission critical task and changing environment, while the Vision Pro is for a static interior environment.  This partnership will enable  TeamViewer  to expand into untapped opportunities with industrial companies. Meanwhile, Almer will be able to scale its operations and advance AR adoption.  Mei Dent , Chief Product & Technology Officer at  TeamViewer :  \u201cApproximately 80 percent of the global workforce does not work at a desk but at a company\u2019s frontline, and most of them currently benefit very little from digital transformation. There is immense potential for efficiency and productivity gains by enhancing the frontline work with digital tools and connecting this huge part of the global workforce to their companies' backend system. Our joint offering with Almer allows companies to explore how Augmented Reality opens new opportunities for business and operations and massively increases the speed of their digitalization efforts.\u201d Almer was founded in 2021 by  Sebastian Beetschen  and  Timon Binder . Sebastian was working on the Hololens 2 at  Microsoft Research  and felt the AR opportunity extended beyond clunky helmet-like apparatus. He felt he could make a more compact, comfortable, and affordable AR device and teamed up with Timon, a former jet fighter pilot, who recognized the potential. Timon brought his experience with AR jet fighter helmets that led to the creation of the Almer Arc headset.  Sebastian Beetschen , CEO and co-founder of Almer  commented: \u201cOur headset is much like a jet fighter visor, mounted directly in front of your eyes, featuring a transparent, see-through screen. The Almer Arc is a lightweight, compact, and easy-to-use AR headset. When a problem arises, the frontline worker takes the Almer Arc and contacts a remote expert, who can see and hear what the worker experiences. The expert identifies the issue, highlights objects, and displays documentation in the worker's view, simulating a collaborative, in-person experience.\u201d Today, Almer has 21 customers, including  Switzerland 's largest defense contractor, which uses the Almer Arc to service fighter jets remotely in the US, as well as several international machine manufacturers. Almer is venture backed startup having raised  $7.6m  to date from strategic investors including engineering giant Stena and manufacturing leaders Helbling among others. The Almer team consists of top talent from the fields of computer vision and microtechnology, from renowned Swiss institutes of technology, ETH and EPFL.  On the launch of Arc 2,  Sebastian Beetschen   commented: \u201cWe have learned a lot on how to make the headset super adaptable and users can set their preferences on how they wear it. Something new entrants like  Apple  still have to learn. Not only this, Arc 2 comes with an improved wide angle 25MP camera that can see and understand everything that you see and zoom into tiny details as never before. This makes it possible to understand the environment and assist, enabling superhuman capabilities\u201d.  The global augmented reality market* is projected to grow from  $62.75 billion  in 2023 to  $1,1 trillion  2030, at a CAGR of 50.7%. Within this trend, the market for AR headsets is exponentially increasing over the next few years and is set to hit  $120 billion  in 2026. Initially, Almer is focusing on the Swiss industry and will soon expand into the neighboring DACH region before going global.  Sebastian Beetschen  added: \u201cThe cost saving potential of using AR to service all installed machines for the 10 largest tooling-machine manufacturers in DACH alone accounts for \u00a37.9 billion per year**. So, the opportunity is very real\u201d.  * Fortune Business Insights,  Technology / Augmented Reality (AR) Market  and  Grand View Research ,  Augmented Reality Headsets Market, Industry Report ** According to Acceliox, a machine hour in the sheet metal industry costs approx.  150 CHF /h and has downtimes (machine malfunction, adjustment, waiting for pre-material,...) of about 100 hours per month. This results in approx. 15' 000 CHF  downtime costs / month (180\u2019000 CHF / year). According to Acceliox, approx. 5% of the planned and unplanned downtime can be eliminated with the Almer remote support, resulting in cost savings of approx. 9\u2019000 CHF / machine and year.

            "articleText": "Apple announces changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store in the European Union \n \n\n Business Wire \n\n \n\n \n \n For developers, the changes include new options for app distribution and payment processing \n\n \n For users, the changes include new controls and disclosures, and expanded protections to reduce privacy and security risks the DMA creates \n\n \n      CUPERTINO, Calif. --(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nApple\u00ae today announced changes to iOS, Safari\u00ae, and the App Store\u00ae impacting developers\u2019 apps in the  European Union  (EU) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The changes include more than 600 new APIs, expanded app analytics, functionality for alternative browser engines, and options for processing app payments and distributing iOS apps. Across every change,  Apple  is introducing new safeguards that reduce \u2014 but don\u2019t eliminate \u2014 new risks the DMA poses to EU users. With these steps,  Apple  will continue to deliver the best, most secure experience possible for EU users.\n\n This press release features multimedia. View the full release here:  https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240125068597/en/ (Graphic: Business Wire) \nThe new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats. That\u2019s why  Apple  is introducing protections \u2014 including Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures on alternative payments \u2014 to reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience possible for users in the EU. Even with these safeguards in place, many risks remain.\n\n \nDevelopers can learn about these changes on the  Apple  Developer Support page  and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in  March 2024 .\n\n \n\u201cThe changes we\u2019re announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act\u2019s requirements in the  European Union , while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings. Our priority remains creating the best, most secure possible experience for our users in the EU and around the world,\u201d said  Phil Schiller ,  Apple  Fellow. \u201cDevelopers can now learn about the new tools and terms available for alternative app distribution and alternative payment processing, new capabilities for alternative browser engines and contactless payments, and more. Importantly, developers can choose to remain on the same business terms in place today if they prefer.\u201d\n\n \nThe changes for EU apps reflect the European Commission\u2019s designation of iOS, Safari, and the  App Store  as \u201ccore platform services\u201d under the Digital Markets Act. In March,  Apple  will share new resources to help EU users understand the changes they can expect. That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities the DMA\u2019s changes bring \u2014 including a less intuitive user experience \u2014 and best practices for approaching new risks associated with downloading apps and processing payments outside of the  App Store .\n\n \nAvailable for developers\u2019 apps around the world,  Apple  also announced  new options for streaming games , along with more than 50 forthcoming reports in areas like engagement, commerce, app usage, and more.\n\n \n Changes to iOS \n\n \nIn the EU,  Apple  is making a number of changes to iOS to comply with the DMA. For developers, those changes include new options for distributing apps. The coming changes to iOS in the EU include:\n\n \n \n New options for distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces  \u2014 including new APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces.\n\n \n \n New framework and APIs for creating alternative app marketplaces  \u2014 enabling marketplace developers to install apps and manage updates on behalf of other developers from their dedicated marketplace app.\n\n \n \n New frameworks and APIs for alternative browser engines  \u2014 enabling developers to use browser engines, other than WebKit, for browser apps and apps with in-app browsing experiences.\n\n \n \n Interoperability request form  \u2014 where developers can submit additional requests for interoperability with iPhone\u00ae and iOS hardware and software features.\n\n \n \nAs announced by the  European Commission ,  Apple  is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments. That includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area. And in the EU,  Apple  is introducing new controls that allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app \u2014 or an alternative app marketplace \u2014 as their default.\n\n \nInevitably, the new options for developers\u2019 EU apps create new risks to  Apple  users and their devices.  Apple  can\u2019t eliminate those risks, but within the DMA\u2019s constraints, the company will take steps to reduce them. These safeguards will be in place when users download iOS 17.4 or later, beginning in March, and include:\n\n \n \n Notarization for iOS apps  \u2014 a baseline review that applies to all apps, regardless of their distribution channel, focused on platform integrity and protecting users. Notarization involves a combination of automated checks and human review.\n\n \n \n App installation sheets  \u2014 that use information from the Notarization process to provide at-a-glance descriptions of apps and their functionality before download, including the developer, screenshots, and other essential information.\n\n \n \n Authorization for marketplace developers  \u2014 to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers.\n\n \n \n Additional malware protections  \u2014 that prevent iOS apps from launching if they\u2019re found to contain malware after being installed to a user\u2019s device.\n\n \n \nThese protections \u2014 including Notarization for iOS apps, and authorization for marketplace developers \u2014 help reduce some of the privacy and security risks to iOS users in the EU. That includes threats like malware or malicious code, and risks of installing apps that misrepresent their functionality or the responsible developer.\n\n \nHowever,  Apple  has less ability to address other risks \u2014 including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content. In addition, apps that use alternative browser engines \u2014 other than Apple\u2019s WebKit \u2014 may negatively affect the user experience, including impacts to system performance and battery life.\n\n \nWithin the DMA\u2019s constraints,  Apple  is committed to protecting the privacy, security, and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible. For instance, App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the  App Store  \u2014 asking a user\u2019s permission before a developer tracks their data across apps or websites. However, the DMA\u2019s requirements mean that  App Store  features \u2014 including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy \u2014 will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the  App Store .\n\n \nWhen these changes come into effect in March,  Apple  will share more detailed resources explaining the options available to users \u2014 including best practices for protecting their privacy and security.\n\n \n Changes to Safari \n\n \nToday, iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser \u2014 other than Safari \u2014 as their default. Reflecting the DMA\u2019s requirements,  Apple  is also introducing a new choice screen that will surface when users first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options.\n\n \nThis change is a result of the DMA\u2019s requirements, and means that EU users will be confronted with a list of default browsers before they have the opportunity to understand the options available to them. The screen also interrupts EU users\u2019 experience the first time they open Safari intending to navigate to a webpage.\n\n \n Changes to the  App Store \n\n \nOn the  App Store ,  Apple  is sharing a number of changes for developers with apps in the EU, affecting apps across Apple\u2019s operating systems \u2014 including iOS, iPadOS\u00ae, macOS\u00ae, watchOS\u00ae, and tvOS\u00ae. The changes also include new disclosures informing EU users of the risks associated with using alternatives to the App Store\u2019s secure payment processing.\n\n \nFor developers, those changes include:\n\n \n \n New options for using payment service providers (PSPs)  \u2014 within a developer\u2019s app to process payments for digital goods and services.\n\n \n \n New options for processing payments via link-out  \u2014 where users can complete a transaction for digital goods and services on the developer\u2019s external website. Developers can also inform EU users of promotions, discounts, and other deals available outside of their apps.\n\n \n \n Business planning tools  \u2014 for developers to estimate fees and understand metrics associated with Apple\u2019s new business terms for apps in the EU.\n\n \n \nThe changes also include new steps to protect and inform EU users, including:\n\n \n \n App Store  product page labels  \u2014 that inform users when an app they\u2019re downloading uses alternative payment processing.\n\n \n \n In-app disclosure sheets  \u2014 that let users know when they are no longer transacting with  Apple , and when a developer is directing them to transact using an alternative payment processor.\n\n \n \n New   App Review processes  \u2014 to verify that developers accurately communicate information about transactions that use alternative payment processors.\n\n \n \n Expanded data portability on Apple\u2019s Data & Privacy site \u2014 where EU users can retrieve new data about their usage of the  App Store  and export it to an authorized third party.\n\n \n \nFor apps that use alternative payment processing,  Apple  will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud.  Helpful App Store  features \u2014 like Report a Problem, Family Sharing, and Ask to Buy \u2014 will also not reflect these transactions. Users may have to share their payment information with additional parties, creating more opportunities for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information. And on the  App Store , users\u2019 purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using the App Store\u2019s In- App Purchase  system.\n\n \n New Business Terms for Apps in the EU \n\n \nAlso today,  Apple  is sharing new business terms available for developers\u2019 apps in the  European Union . Developers can choose to adopt these new business terms, or stay on Apple\u2019s existing terms. Developers must adopt the new business terms for EU apps to use the new capabilities for alternative distribution or alternative payment processing.\n\n \nDevelopers operating under either set of business terms can continue to use the App Store\u2019s secure payment processing and share their apps on the  App Store  in the EU. And both sets of business terms reflect Apple\u2019s long-standing work to make the app ecosystem the best opportunity for all developers.\n\n \nThe new business terms for apps in the EU are necessary to support the DMA\u2019s requirements for alternative distribution and payment processing. That includes a fee structure that reflects the many ways  Apple  creates value for developers\u2019 businesses \u2014 including distribution and discovery on the  App Store , the App Store\u2019s secure payment processing, Apple\u2019s trusted and secure mobile platform, and all the tools and technology to build and share innovative apps with users around the world.\n\n \nDevelopers operating under the new business terms will have the option to distribute their iOS apps from the  App Store  and/or alternative app marketplaces. These developers can also choose to use alternative payment processors in their EU apps on the  App Store , across Apple\u2019s operating systems.\n\n \nThe new business terms for iOS apps in the EU have three elements:\n\n \n \n Reduced commission  \u2014 iOS apps on the  App Store  will pay a reduced commission of either 10 percent (for the vast majority of developers and subscriptions following their first year) or 17 percent on transactions for digital goods and services.\n\n \n \n Payment processing fee  \u2014 iOS apps on the  App Store  can use the App Store\u2019s payment processing for an additional 3 percent fee. Developers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to  Apple .\n\n \n \n Core Technology Fee  \u2014 iOS apps distributed from the  App Store  and/or an alternative app marketplace will pay \u20ac0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold.\n\n \n \n \n \n Under the new business terms for EU apps,  Apple  estimates that: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n More than 99 percent of developers would reduce or maintain the fees they owe to  Apple . \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n Less than 1 percent of developers would pay a Core Technology Fee on their EU apps. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nFor apps on iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS in the EU, developers who process payments using a PSP or by linking out to their website will get a 3 percent discount on the commission they owe to  Apple .\n\n \n Apple  is also sharing a  fee calculator tool  and new reports to help developers estimate the potential impact of the new business terms on their app businesses. Developers can learn more about the changes for EU apps on a new  Apple  Developer Support page  and can begin testing these capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta.\n\n \n Apple  revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today,  Apple  leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac,  Apple  Watch, and  Apple  TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all  Apple  devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the  App Store ,  Apple  Music,  Apple  Pay, and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n\n \nNOTE TO EDITORS: For additional information visit  Apple  Newsroom ( www.apple.com/newsroom ), or email Apple\u2019s Media Helpline at  media.help@apple.com .\n\n \n\u00a9 2024  Apple Inc.

HKSTP truly believes innovation is global and with  Hong Kong  entering a golden era for I&T, it is the ideal launchpad for success in  Asia  and beyond.\" \n During the visits to  Stanford University , the pre-eminent US institution for tech talent, the leadership team met with the  Department of Management Science and Engineering ,  School of Engineering , and  Graduate School of Business  to explore partnerships on talent initiatives. HKSTP hosted a career session that highlighted exciting I&T career paths in  Hong Kong , while HKSTP's CEO  Albert Wong  introduced the internship and graduate opportunities offered by HKSTP to over 50  Stanford  students from different faculties. \n To engage the  Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students  (BASES) with highly influential alumni and innovative students, a networking session was held in which Albert outlined the career journey and differences in multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in the US,  Asia-Pacific  and  China . By contrasting leadership roles in MNCs with entrepreneurial management experiences, participants were inspired to adventure into the I&T ecosystem in  Hong Kong , unlocking the tremendous potential for global investors and talent through this important gateway to  China  and Asian markets. \n Collaborations on talent nurturing with  UC Berkeley  reached new heights. HKSTP delegation met with the University's Director of  International Partnership , Dr  Matthew Sherburne , to explore opportunities on startup partnerships and internship programmes. The team paid a visit to  UC Berkeley's   Mechanical Systems Control Lab , supervised by Professor  Masayoshi Tomizuka , who is also the Co-Director of  Hong Kong Centre for Logistics Robotics , InnoHK. The research team showed immense interest in the funding and support to R&D in  Hong Kong . \n The  West Coast  tour also included meetings with global tech leaders NVIDIA,  Google , LinkedIn; US venture capital firms such as TSVC;  Silicon Valley  based innovation and entrepreneurship platforms such as  JJ Lake  and Q Bay Center; Israeli accelerator UPWEST LABS, among others, with extensive talks to explore and deepen cooperations. The delegation engaged with companies from the life sciences, AI, fintech and cybersecurity sectors that expressed keen interest in Asian expansion. \n In addition, HKSTP and the  Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office  (HKETO) organised a reception dinner that attracted around 150 tech professionals from leading enterprises, universities and venture capital firms including  Apple ,  Google ,  Stanford University ,  UC Berkeley ,  JP Morgan  and  East West Bank . Participants were informed of the surge in investment and resources in  Hong Kong's  thriving I&T sector. \n \"HKSTP Innovation Mixer\" was launched in 2023 as an outreach programme aimed at connecting with enterprises and talent from around the world to grow  Hong Kong  and  Asia's  collective innovation ecosystems. HKSTP demonstrated its integrated ecosystem of infrastructure, R&D, consultation, funding, partner matching and market development services, which help tech enterprises at all stages of their innovation journey.

            "articleText": "What Steep iPhone Discount from JD, Alibaba Means for Apple Stock \n \n\n Baystreet.ca \n\n \n\n \n \n When the media reported that  Apple  (AAPL) slashed iPhone prices in  China  ahead of the country\u2019s new year, the bearishness failed to hurt its share price. \n Apple\u2019s price cut is only temporary, lasting for a week. Domestic e-commerce firms JD and  Alibaba  (BABA) offered even bigger discounts than that of  Apple . This may sound troubling for  Apple  iPhone sales. \n Fortunately, Apple\u2019s smartphone sales are unique. China\u2019s economy is in a slump that it could not shake off ever since it reopened in  November 2022 . Manufacturing activity continues to fall as Western firms de-risk their supply chain out of  China . As a result, unemployment is higher. For those who still have a job, people have less disposable income. \n Bears may criticize the lack of innovation for the iPhone 15. Yet the company will grow global sales by targeting  India  and other emerging Asian nations. It is unlikely to cut prices elsewhere, especially in  U.S.  markets. \n Apple  investors should not worry about the company\u2019s slowdown in  China . Instead, foreign investors exposed to this country should worry about more downside ahead. The government has yet to cut interest rates enough, print money, or remove regulation that hurts its real estate and technology industries."

The broader market owes the rally to the Nasdaq Composite Index, which gained 1.70% on the day. \n Apple  (AAPL) is the stock to watch. The iPhone giant launched an expensive  Apple  Vision Pro. Unfortunately, major firms are snubbing the headset.

Without it, consumers are unlikely to pay the premium price when it has limited use. It forces  Apple  to develop custom VR-ready applications at a considerable expense. \n Multiples Expand \n The S&P 500\u2019s rally expanded the price-to-earnings multiples. It increases the risk of stretched valuations leading to a correction. The market rally is dependent on excessively bullish sentiment. Value investors may pivot to cheaper stocks to hedge their bets. However, this strategy may not work well.  \n As long as investors avoid the inexpensive  China  technology stocks, they should avoid losses should markets lose momentum.  China  tech stocks are cheap because the country is in a steepening recession. The less followed stocks like  Joyy Inc.

To assist Casino777 gamblers in avoiding these pitfalls, the brand suggests users adhere to their distinct platform guidelines. This Spanish  online casino  gives extra aid to users to spot when they are going overboard through the use of the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) and NODS questionnaires. The first (SOGS) consists of thirteen questions that aim to sport pathological betting behavior, and the latter questionnaire (NODS), based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, does the same via criteria set by the  American Psychiatric Association . Self-exclusion and self-restriction are also live at Casino777.es. These settings include activating self-imposed bans, placing deposit limits, and further control tools. The latter are designed for user protection and can get adjusted to individual requirements. For any questions about these, any Spanish gambler thinking of using Casino777.es from  Spain  can reach the platform\u2019s staff using their hotline, whose number is +34 931 222 841. Casino777 states that gamblers\u2019 well-being is a top priority, advising everyone to never forget to set limits and forego playing when under the influence of stimulants. The site outright proclaims that users must prioritize maintaining healthy relationships with family and friends over excessive gaming. Hence, their website features a self-assessment through Play Well and additional tests, which become available if needed. Spain\u2019s Post-2020 Devotion to Responsible Gambling In 2020, on the heels of the UKGC launching its mandatory self-exclusion scheme,  GamStop , run by the  National Online Self Exclusion Scheme Limited  non-for-profit organization, representatives of  Spain 's autonomous communities, including Ceuta and Melilla, agreed to integrate their individual self-exclusion programs. The goal of the birth of these was to enhance coordinated player protection efforts at local and national levels in  Spain . The landmark decision got reached at a meeting chaired by Minister of Consumer Affairs Alberto Garz\u00f3n at the  National Gambling Policy Council . Even with Catalonia opposing the measure and the Basque and Valencian communities abstaining from the vote, it still received majority approval.  Self-exclusion programs are now becoming the norm in regulated European markets. In  Germany , gamblers can choose to get excluded from online betting activities using the Oasis scheme. Swedes can do so through Spelpaus, and Dutch players can activate a self-imposed ban on Internet betting using the CRUKS, the Centraal Register Uitsluiting Kansspelen. In 2020, Spanish representatives collaborated to develop the regulatory framework required for an integrated self-exclusion program. It marked an initiative in  Spain 's efforts to strengthen player protection in the gambling sector, something the government has particularly been focusing on for years, expressed primarily through advertising restrictions. After the discussed move, the Directorate General for the Regulation of Gambling (DGOJ), or the  Spanish National Gambling Commission , noted a 13.6% rise in excluded Spanish gamblers in 2021. In 2022,  Spain 's market saw another set of significant changes as the  Senate  approved reforms to the country's 2011 Gambling Law. These amendments got voted in favor by 146 members, and they aimed to enhance controls on betting fraud and deliver greater protection for problem gamblers. The most essential proposal in this amendment batch was the establishment of a central database called the  Global Betting Market Research Service , managed by the  DGOJ , that would share information with law enforcement, licensed operators, and regional authorities. The new rules also required operators to ensure socially responsible advertisements and notify users of safer gambling information upon entering a gaming/betting website/app. About Casino777.es Founded in 2016, the Spanish version of Casino777 gets operated by Digital Distribution Management Ib\u00e9rica SA (a  Casino de Spa  subsidiary/partner).

Ahead of last year\u2019s annual meeting,  National Legal and Policy Center  \u2013 a shareholder in  Apple  \u2013 called for fellow investors  to oppose Gore\u2019s reelection , explaining in a  lengthy memo filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission  why he was unqualified to serve in such an influential leadership role and was detrimental to the company. NLPC wrote in part: Mr. Gore  has held a position on Apple\u2019s board since 2003, despite having no relevant experience in technology or core business functions. His primary benefit to the board is his supposed climate change expertise. However, Mr. Gore\u2019s public reputation is inconsistent with his track record, his carbon-intensive lifestyle, and his actual investments. Instead, he has used his public advocacy as a tool for personal enrichment. In addition, his political activism poses to  Apple  a reputational risk that is not worth his limited skillset. Following the announcement,  Paul Chesser , Director of NLPC\u2019s  Corporate Integrity Project , stated: \u201cAl Gore was Apple\u2019s longest serving director, for more than 20 years \u2013 but he never should have even served a day. How influential were his many distortions and exagerations over the years about energy and climate? How much more did his policy preferences increase the costs of  Apple  products to unaffordable highs for many more potential customers? How much did his hypocritical jet-setting and personal electricity use undermine the company\u2019s reputation?\u201d \u201cApple is a great company, but it would have been even greater without the presence of  Al Gore . Good riddance.\u201d NLPC is also sponsoring a  shareholder proposal  at the upcoming annual meeting, which seeks accountability from the  Cupertino, Calif. -based tech giant about its human rights policies versus its actions. Founded in 1991, NLPC promotes ethics in public life and government accountability through research, investigation, education, and legal action. ###   For more information or to schedule an interview with  Paul Chesser , contact  Dan Rene  at 202-329-8357 or  drene@nlpc.org .

After rewarding shareholders last year and for years before that, analysts are voicing concerns. \n AAPL stock gained 46% last year and is due to fall from profit-taking. Analysts are the biggest headwinds on the stock price action. They speculate without decisively knowing that iPhone sales will weaken. \n Markets did not sell the stock when  Apple  posted slow iPhone sales. Sentiment shifted this year, which pressures  Apple  to deliver strong results. \n Courts helped  Apple  avoid a ban on  Apple  Watch sales. This is a setback for Massimo (MASI), which accused it of hiring its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and intellectual property, and incorporating them in Apple\u2019s smartwatch.  The ITC had barred imports and sales last  Dec. 2023 . \n The US appellate court temporarily reserved the ban on the  Apple   Watch Ultra  2 and  Watch Series  9 models. Once  Apple  continues its fight against Massimo in court, chances are good that it will come out ahead.  \n Apple  may decide to settle the case instead. This would remove future uncertainties hurting AAPL stock. \n On the charts, traders tried several times in the last year to push the stock to above  $200 . It failed each time. The bearish pattern suggested the stock would continue its downtrend. \n Apple  is an expensive stock. Other than correcting for a lower price-to-earnings multiple, its prospects remain strong."

            "articleText": "Why Analysts Downgraded Palantir, Apple, and More \n \n\n Baystreet.ca \n\n \n\n \n \n Analysts wield too much power in the stock market. Their rating change will move the stock, if only for a few days. \n On  Jan. 5 ,  Palantir  (PLTR) slipped when Jefferies downgraded the stock and set a low price of  $13  as the price target. The analyst thought the AI story around  Palantir  probably ran its course. Still, the analyst said that the firm offers customers a highly differentiated platform. The moat around data analysis ensures stable growth for the long term. \n The downgrade on  Apple  (AAPL) is a bigger negative turn of events. Shares peaked at  $199.62 , shy of  $200  before analysts at Piper Sandler downgraded the stock. Analyst  Harsh Kumar  downgraded AAPL stock to neutral, citing worries about iPhone inventory levels. Peak unit sales growth is also a concern. \n Unless customers worry about their budget, they will not delay their iPhone upgrade. AAPL stock lost its  $3 trillion  market capitalization last week. \n With short interest of 14.36%, the downgrade on  SoFi Technologies  (SOFI), a digital bank, sent the stock down 14.3% last week. SoFi does not trade at a good valuation, so markets sold SOFI stock after KBW\u2019s downgrade to Underperform. \n CEO Noto expects SoFi will post a profit in its upcoming earnings report. Expect this analyst to upgrade the stock after shares rally after the report."

Last week, autonomous chip supplier Mobileye (MBLY) lost 32% of its value after issuing a warning. \n Last Friday, beat up  REIT Medical Properties Trust  (MPW) lost 30%, closing at prices not seen since 2009 (15 years ago). The firm took steps to recover uncollected rents from its tenant,  Stewart Health Care System , yet granted that same firm a  $60 million  loan. Trade MPW stock today instead of treating it as an income REIT. \n Apple  (AAPL) is about to find support at  $180  on the 200 day simple moving average. Without its leadership this morning, smaller technology stocks by market cap size will struggle to find direction. In the consumer electronics sector, watch Sony (SONY) and retailer Best Buy (BBY). Among the tech companies, watch Microsoft (MSFT), which is about to overtake  Apple  in size. \n Watch for upside moves in Nvidia (NVDA), an AI leader while the more diversified firm, Broadcom (AVGO) fights to hold its upside at  $1,048 . Investors are still buying AI stock. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is a better choice than Nvidia, based on valuation. \n On the S&P 500, avoid Lumen Technologies (LUMN), the worst performing stock. Its CEO is a former Microsoft executive."

The obesity drug is a hot growth catalyst in the pharmaceutical space like AI is to technology. \n In the crypto market, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC-USD) dip ahead of an expected decision on the spot ETF will move the miners and platforms. Watch  Coinbase  (COIN),  Marathon Digital  (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK), and Microstrategy (MSTR). \n Bitcoin enjoyed an uptrend from its  $17,700  low to around  $43,800 . Bullishness depended almost entirely on expectations that the  SEC  would approve a spot bitcoin ETF. The market is not prepared for the  SEC  delaying the approval, nor is it ready for conditions or unnecessarily extra regulations. \n With credit conditions extremely tight, no matter the talk of rate cuts, avoid the meme stocks. AMC Entertainment traded at an all-time low of  $5.08  last Friday. Trading volume should rise this morning as speculators capitulate. They will book losses instead of holding strong (\u201cApes Together Strong\u201d).  \n Speculative stocks like QuantumScrape are similarly meme-like stocks. They do not have any profits. Fisker (FSR), which is unlikely to meet its production targets, is also a stock to avoid."

(Photo: Business Wire) \n\u201cThe era of spatial computing has arrived,\u201d said  Tim Cook , Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cApple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore.\u201d\n\n \n A Revolutionary Operating System and User Interface \n\n \n Apple  Vision Pro is powered by visionOS, which is built on the foundation of decades of engineering innovation in macOS\u00ae, iOS, and iPadOS\u00ae. visionOS delivers powerful spatial experiences, unlocking new opportunities at work and at home. Featuring a brand-new three-dimensional user interface and input system controlled entirely by a user\u2019s eyes, hands, and voice, navigation feels magical. Intuitive gestures allow users to interact with apps by simply looking at them, tapping their fingers to select, flicking their wrist to scroll, or using a virtual keyboard or dictation to type. With Siri\u00ae, users can quickly open or close apps, play media, and more.\n\n \nUsers can also immerse themselves in Environments \u2014 dynamic, beautiful landscapes like Haleakal\u0101,  Joshua Tree , and  Yosemite  national parks, and even the surface of the moon \u2014 to help them focus or reduce clutter in busy spaces. With Environments, a user\u2019s world can grow beyond the dimensions of a physical room. With a twist of the Digital Crown\u00ae, users can control how present or immersed they are in an environment.\n\n \n Extraordinary Experiences \n\n \n Apple  Vision Pro brings a new dimension to powerful, personal computing by changing the way users interact with their apps. The three-dimensional interface frees apps from the boundaries of a display so they can appear side by side at any scale, providing the ultimate workspace and creating an infinite canvas for multitasking and collaborating.\n\n \nSince visionOS leverages existing developer frameworks, more than 1 million familiar apps across iOS and iPadOS are available on  Apple  Vision Pro and automatically work with the new input system. Vision Pro also has an all-new  App Store  where users can find apps that deliver spatial computing experiences unlike any other platform. Apps can be arranged anywhere and scaled to the perfect size, all while allowing the user to stay present in their space.\n\n \n \n An infinite canvas for productivity :   With key productivity and collaboration apps like Fantastical, Freeform\u2122, JigSpace, apps from Microsoft 365, and Slack,  Apple  Vision Pro is an ideal productivity tool for everyday tasks. Apps can appear side by side at any scale for incredible multitasking, and with support for Magic Keyboard\u00ae and Magic Trackpad\u00ae, users can create the perfect workspace. With Mac\u00ae Virtual Display, users can even bring the powerful capabilities of their Mac into Vision Pro, creating an enormous, private, and portable 4K display, ideal for pro workflows.\n\n \n \n The ultimate entertainment experience :  Apple  Vision Pro features ultra-high-resolution displays that deliver more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye, enabling users to watch movies and TV shows from  Apple  TV+\u00ae, Disney+, Max, and other services on a screen that feels 100 feet wide with support for HDR content. Within the  Apple  TV\u00ae app, users can access more than 150 3D titles with incredible depth wherever they are. Vision Pro also introduces  Apple  Immersive Video\u2122, a remarkable new entertainment format pioneered by  Apple  that puts users inside the action with 180-degree, three-dimensional 8K recordings captured with Spatial Audio. Users can also enjoy new interactive experiences like Encounter Dinosaurs.\n\n \n \n New gaming experiences : Players can access games on the  App Store , including more than 250 titles on  Apple  Arcade\u00ae. Hit games like NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition and Sonic Dream Team can be played on a screen as large as they want with incredible audio and support for popular game controllers. New spatial games, including  Game Room , What the Golf?, and Super Fruit Ninja, take advantage of the powerful capabilities of  Apple  Vision Pro to transform the space around players, offering unique and engaging gameplay experiences.\n\n \n \n Memories Brought to Life \n\n \n Apple  Vision Pro enables users to capture and relive their favorite memories in entirely new ways. Spatial photos and videos transport users back to a special moment in time, and Spatial Audio makes the experience incredibly immersive. When users are on the go, they can capture spatial video on their iPhone\u00ae 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and relive them on Vision Pro. Users can also view all their photos and videos at a life-size scale with brilliant color and spectacular detail, including Panoramas that expand and wrap around the user, making them feel like they are right where it was taken.\n\n \n FaceTime Becomes Spatial \n\n \nFaceTime\u00ae on  Apple  Vision Pro takes advantage of the space around the user so that everyone on a call appears life-size, while Spatial Audio makes it sound like each person\u2019s voice comes from the location of their tile. If a user is wearing Vision Pro while on FaceTime, they appear as their Persona, while others joining from a Mac, iPad\u00ae, or iPhone will appear in a tile.\n\n \nPersona is an authentic spatial representation of an  Apple  Vision Pro user that enables others on a call to see their facial expressions and hand movements \u2014 all in real time. 1  Using machine learning techniques, a Persona can be created in just minutes using Vision Pro. Personas also work in third-party videoconferencing apps including Zoom,  Cisco Webex , and Microsoft Teams.\n\n \n Breakthrough Design \n\n \n Apple  Vision Pro builds on  Apple  innovation and experience designing high-performance products like Mac, iPhone, and wearables like  Apple  Watch\u00ae, culminating in the most advanced personal electronics device ever. An astonishing amount of technology is packed into a beautiful, compact design that utilizes the most advanced materials possible to achieve ambitious goals for performance, mobility, and wearability.\n\n \n Apple  Vision Pro is designed as a modular system so users can personalize their fit. A singular piece of three-dimensionally formed, laminated glass gently curves around the user\u2019s face and flows into the custom aluminum alloy frame. The Light Seal is made of a soft textile and comes in a range of shapes and sizes, flexing to conform to a user\u2019s face for a precise fit. Flexible straps ensure audio remains close to the user\u2019s ears, while the included  Solo Knit Band  and  Dual Loop Band  allow users to find the optimal fit for them. For those with vision correction needs, ZEISS Optical Inserts are available with a prescription or as readers that magnetically attach to Vision Pro, allowing users to take full advantage of the display\u2019s incredible sharpness and clarity. 2 \n\n \n Unrivaled Innovation \n\n \n Apple  Vision Pro is designed to deliver phenomenal compute performance in a compact wearable form factor. Featuring a breakthrough ultra-high-resolution display system built on top of  Apple  silicon, Vision Pro uses micro-OLED technology to pack 23 million pixels into two displays, each the size of a postage stamp, with wide color and high dynamic range. This technological breakthrough, combined with custom lenses that enable incredible sharpness and clarity, and advanced Spatial Audio, delivers jaw-dropping experiences.\n\n \n Apple  Vision Pro also features a high-performance eye tracking system that uses high-speed cameras and a ring of LEDs that project invisible light patterns onto the user\u2019s eyes for responsive, intuitive input. And to help the user stay connected to the people around them,  Apple  designed a groundbreaking new feature called EyeSight\u2122. When a person approaches someone wearing Vision Pro, the device looks transparent \u2014 letting the user see them while also displaying the user\u2019s eyes. When a user is immersed in an Environment or using an app, EyeSight gives visual cues to others about what the user is focused on.\n\n \nThe breakthrough display, advanced audio experiences, high-performance eye tracking system, and more are powered by  Apple  silicon in a unique dual-chip design. The M2 chip delivers powerful standalone performance, while the brand-new R1 chip processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user\u2019s eyes.\n\n \n Privacy and Security at Its Core \n\n \n Apple  Vision Pro offers industry-leading privacy and security. Optic ID\u2122 is a new authentication system that analyzes a user\u2019s iris to unlock Vision Pro, autofill passwords, and complete payments with  Apple  Pay\u00ae. Where a user looks stays private while navigating Vision Pro, and eye tracking information is not shared with  Apple , third-party apps, or websites. EyeSight also includes a visual indicator that makes it clear to others when a user is capturing a spatial photo or video.\n\n \n Accessibility in visionOS \n\n \nAs with all  Apple  products, powerful accessibility features have been built right into visionOS. Key accessibility features like VoiceOver, Zoom, Switch Control, Guided Access\u00ae, and more have been reimagined for spatial computing. Users can interact with  Apple  Vision Pro entirely with their eyes, hands, or voice, or any combination that works best for them. They can select a preferred input method such as their eyes, finger, or wrist using Pointer Control, pause on an element of visionOS for a few seconds to simulate a tap using Dwell Control, or simply use voice commands for activities across Vision Pro using Voice Control. If input from both eyes is not an option, visionOS also allows eye tracking with one dominant eye.\n\n \n Apple  Vision Pro and the Environment \n\n \n Apple  Vision Pro is designed with the environment in mind, with 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled tin soldering and gold plating in multiple printed circuit boards. The frame and battery enclosure contain 100 percent recycled aluminum, and the  Light Seal and Solo Knit Band  are each made with over 70 percent recycled yarn. Vision Pro meets Apple\u2019s high standards for energy efficiency and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, PVC, and beryllium. The packaging is 100 percent fiber-based, bringing  Apple  closer to its goal of eliminating plastics in all packaging by 2025.\n\n \nToday,  Apple  is carbon neutral for its global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and life cycle of every product.\n\n \n Pricing and Availability \n\n \n \n Apple  Vision Pro will be available starting at   $3,499  ( U.S. ) with 256GB of storage. Pre-orders for  Apple  Vision Pro will begin on  Friday, January 19 , at  5 a.m. PST , with availability beginning  Friday, February 2 .\n\n \n \n Apple  Vision Pro will be available at all  U.S. Apple Store  locations and the  U.S. Apple Store  online.\n\n \n \nZEISS Optical Inserts \u2014 Readers will be available for  $99  ( U.S. ), and ZEISS Optical Inserts \u2014 Prescription will be available for  $149  ( U.S. ).\n\n \n \n Apple  Vision Pro comes with a  Solo Knit Band  and  Dual Loop Band  \u2014 giving users two options for the fit that works best for them.  Apple  Vision Pro also includes a Light Seal, two Light Seal Cushions, an  Apple  Vision Pro Cover for the front of the device, Polishing Cloth, Battery, USB-C Charge Cable, and USB-C Power Adapter.\n\n \n \n Apple  revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today,  Apple  leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac,  Apple  Watch, and  Apple  TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all  Apple  devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the  App Store ,  Apple  Music,  Apple  Pay, and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n\n \n 1  Persona is available in beta.\n\n \n 2  A valid prescription is required.

            "articleText": "Apple Stock Gets Off to Bumpy Start in 2024 \n \n\n Baystreet.ca \n\n \n\n \n \n Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) came into 2024 riding high from the strong earnings it delivered in the previous year. However, the technology giant has got off to a difficult start in the New Year. Shares of  Apple  have dropped 3.17% \tso far in 2024 as of close on  Friday, January 5, 2024 . The stock is still up 39% in the year-over-year period.  \n Should investors consider its recent slump a buying opportunity? \n The company\u2019s stock slid to close out the week after it was reported on  Friday, January 5 , that the  United States Justice Department  is preparing an antitrust lawsuit against  Apple . The report indicates that the antitrust lawsuit could be filed as soon as this year. Moreover, it would represent the biggest antitrust risk for the company in years. \n Reports state that the antitrust lawsuit could target how the  Apple  Watch works exclusively with the iPhone and the iMessage service. There could also be a focus on  Apple  Pay. If the lawsuit moves forward, it would represent the largest antitrust lawsuit for  Apple  in years.  Apple  has also faced regulatory risks due to a crackdown in  Europe  over Apple\u2019s  App Store . The company\u2019s growing list of legal and regulatory battles are certainly worth monitoring for investors going forward. \n Apple  is still on track to deliver strong earnings growth going forward. In its most recent quarterly report, CEO  Tim Cook  also stated that  Apple  was investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence. Legal issues aside,  Apple  remains a powerhouse that investors can rely on going forward."

Economists polled by  Dow Jones  expected a gain of 170,000 for last month. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7% in another sign of continued labour strength. \n\n A strong labour market could mean that the Fed might potentially delay the first of its rate cuts, which traders have been eagerly anticipating. Before the strong data hit Friday, traders were hoping the Fed would start cutting rates as early as March and lower them by as many as six times in 2024. Those expectations will need to be dialed back after Friday's report. \n\n The three major averages are all on track to break nine-week winning streaks, with the NASDAQ suffering the biggest loss for the week at 3.3%.The S&P 500 tailed off 1.7%, while the Dow was down 0.7%. \n\n One other factor weighing on the market in the new year is the cooling off large-cap tech stocks like  Apple , which has been downgraded by two research shops this week.  Amy Kong , partner at wealth management company Corient, said her firm is taking a breather from buying the large tech names, several of which make up its top holdings. \n\n Prices for the 10-year  Treasury  gained ground, lowering yields to 3.96% from Thursday's 4%.  Treasury  prices and yields move in opposite directions. \n\n Oil prices took on  $1.73  to  $73.92   U.S.  a barrel. \n\n Gold prices progressed  $19.20  to  $2,069.70 ."

Apple\u2019s stock chart is flashing a \u201cdouble top\u201d bearish warning pattern. Shares traded at  $198  last  August 2023  before falling to  $166 . Between late  October 2023  through mid-December, the stock traded close to  $200 . \n Analysts piled on the downgrades against AAPL stock, even though the appeals court paused the  Apple  Watch ban. It received the second downgrade in four days as of yesterday. Analysts are worried that a huge camera upgrade on the iPhone 17 may not help sales. \n ETF investors should watch the small-cap index. The Russell 2000 ETF, IWM, lost 5.3% in the last week. Trading last at below  $194 , the next support zone is at  $180 . \n Increasingly fearful growth investors might turn to the super-safe dividend stocks. Seeking passive income instead of growth is a dramatic strategic shift. Be wary of changing the game plan.  McDonald\u2019s  (MCD) stock is the third one to watch. The stock already bounced back by 19% from its 52-week low. It pays a dividend that yields only 2.13%. \n Walgreens  (WBA) is the fourth stock to watch. It does not offer safety in dividends. The firm cut its dividend by 48% yesterday. After falling as much as 12%, it closed down by 5.12% to  $24.26 ."

Risk assets enjoyed a big relief rally as the economy remained resilient and inflation cooled, while the  Federal Reserve  signaled an end to rate hikes and forecasted rate cuts later this year. The market also endured a regional banking crisis as well as wars in  Ukraine  and the  Middle East . \n\n Technology shares, especially megacap stocks, led the 2023 advance with  Apple  soaring 48%, Microsoft surging nearly 57% and Nvidia skyrocketing 239%. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite ended the year up 43.4% for its best year since 2020. \n\n That trend was reversing on Tuesday as the new year of trading began with those same stocks declining in early trading.  Apple  shares were down 2% after the negative call from Barclays. The firm said  Apple  could lose about 17% this year because of lackluster iPhone sales. \n\n Microsoft and Nvidia shares were also in the red in early trading. \n\n The blue-chip Dow logged a 13.7% gain and notched a new record during 2023. Part of that rally was helped by a turn in interest rates. \n\n Prices for the 10-year  Treasury  slipped a mite, raising yields to 3.94% from Friday's 3.95%.  Treasury  prices and yields move in opposite directions. \n\n Oil prices decreased  12 cents  to  $71.53   U.S.  a barrel. \n\n Gold prices strengthened  two dollars  to  $2,073.80 ."

            "articleText": "How Super League Enterprise Is Helping Shape The Future Of Web 3.0 With 3D Engagement \n \n\n News Direct \n\n \n\n \n --News Direct-- By  Austin DeNoce , Benzinga Immersive experiences are everywhere around us. The lines between reality and virtual reality are blurrier and more valuable with each passing year, and more and more companies are diving into the digital world headfirst. Super  League Enterprise  (NASDAQ: SLE) is one of those companies as a  leader in crafting engaging virtual experiences . The company leverages its substantial user base to forge connections between global brands and the Web 3.0 and gaming community by harnessing the power of immersive technologies to captivate and connect with a generation that increasingly can only be found in a digital world. The buzz around creating immersive online experiences may be lost on older generations that have been relatively slower entering new digital frontiers, but younger generations have fully embraced 3D engagement. Super League Enterprise\u2019s Immersive Media Expansion The   pioneer in immersive web activations and user engagement  today boasts over a  billion monthly impressions  and over 120 million active players. The company\u2019s mission is to help brands embrace 3D engagement as a fundamental component of Web 3.0, which it believes is the inevitable way digital advertising dollars will be directed in the future for deeper engagement with new audiences. During 2023, the company was a leader in building immersive 3D experiences across  major digital platforms , including  Roblox   (NASDAQ: RBLX), Minecraft which is owned by  Microsoft  (NASDAQ: MSFT), Fortnite, Sandbox and Decentraland. The company's strategy focuses on helping brands connect with large audiences in those established 3D environments. Its creator-friendly tools also help transform owned web domains through custom 3D experiences. Tools For 3D Engagement As brands shift digital advertising to make Web 3.0 connections with Generation Z and Alpha,  Super League  provides creators with a content development platform packed with enough proprietary IP to be an end-to-end operating system for the 3D Web.  Super League  reports that last year turned out to be a year of strong momentum for the company, highlighted by accelerated growth, streamlined operations and the largest contract in the company\u2019s history \u2013 leading to record annual revenues of approximately  $25 million . This highlights their growing role in the metaverse and digital engagement strategies.  The company has  partnered with brands  like Barbie from  Mattel Inc.  (NYSE: MAT),  Patrick Star  (NASDAQ: PARA) and  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.   (NYSE: CMG) to connect brands with gaming communities through immersive experiences. Heading into 2024, the company reports more global brands are navigating into Web 3.0 with a planned ramp-up of ad spending in the nascent marketing channel. \u201cSuper League is uniquely positioned to be the omni-channel solution for 3D engagement in the arena where brands in the near future will likely spend the majority of their digital advertising,\u201d said  Ann Hand , CEO of  Super League . \u201cOur capabilities as a platform for short-term advertising campaigns are evolving and our deals are getting much larger as customers discover the value in deeply immersive experiences that deliver revenues that are more recurring and forecastable.\u201d As an example,  Super League  in 2023 launched the Hamilton Simulator, a Web 3.0 experience that attracted an audience of 6.5 billion for an interactive discovery of the epic  Broadway  saga\u2019s groundbreaking music. The company reports that the experience went viral with over 1 million visits in the first two weeks, surpassing the top session time of  Roblox  experiences at an average of 21 minutes.  Pioneering Immersive Media The landscape of media is quickly changing, forcing brands and creators to adopt new strategies to engage with a younger audience that increasingly socializes online. Industry giants like  Meta Platforms  (NASDAQ: META) have already begun making investments in immersive experiences, and as the shift into the digital world increases with innovations in the metaverse or other similar technologies, immersive media is becoming critical for brands seeking to capture the attention of the next generation. Super League  believes it is on track to be a gold standard for creating multi-layered, persistent 3D Web solutions in a market it expects will reach  $56 billion  this year. The company has pioneered immersive activations and player engagement for close to a decade simply responding to the demand for a scalable, integrated publishing platform for immersive web experiences. Platforms to help brands  leverage their IP in new and creative ways  constitute a growing sector of the media industry. In this new landscape, Super League's approach is clear: equip brands with the knowledge and tools to create engaging digital experiences that drive higher audience engagement and more effective advertising campaigns.  Super League Is Upping Its Game  Last year, the company integrated generative AI technologies into its creative process tools for significant improvements in content development, color inspiration, image adjustments, audio generation and script refinement. It was an evolution for the company\u2019s already robust content visualization and production solutions capabilities that it believes increases internal efficiencies and opportunities for continued, sustained new business and revenue growth. Super  League Enterprise  is capitalizing on the shift toward immersive digital environments. In 2023, it reduced its operating costs by 33% while serving some 100 brands and IP owners to successfully raise gross proceeds of  $24.8 million  and secure  $4 million  in accounts receivable. It last announced preliminary revenue for the fourth quarter that showed it grew 32% year over year to a company record of approximately  $9.4 million . With additional cash from recently secured financings, it\u2019s confident it is now more than ever in a position to drive significant revenue growth leading to profitability. The company's proprietary creator tools and vertically integrated publishing engine could position it as a promising player in the transition to a more interactive and immersive online world.  Ultimately, Super League's growing list of partnerships and commitment to innovation in connecting brands with Web 3.0 and gaming communities highlight their strategic approach to audience engagement and advertising in the new dawn of immersive media.

AUSTIN, Texas ,  Jan. 25, 2024  /PRNewswire/ -- Alepo proudly announces that L\u00fcm Mobile, SaskTel's innovative all-digital mobile brand, has launched L\u00fcmbot, a cutting-edge AI-powered virtual agent from Alepo to deliver an all-digital customer support experience. \n\n     \n                 \n                         \n                     \n                         \n                 \n\n     \n L\u00fcmbot, which lives on L\u00fcm Mobile's website, harnesses the power of Generative AI to provide subscribers with an unparalleled level of interaction. Unlike traditional chatbots constrained by preset rules, Alepo's AI Virtual Agent is able to comprehend and engage in human-like customer service sessions through the use of Large Language Model (LLM). The AI Virtual Agent understands nuanced subscriber interaction and offers a high task completion rate, measured by a drastic reduction in escalations to human agents since it was soft launched late last year. \n L\u00fcmbot is designed to handle a wide range of inputs and can understand context, resulting in dynamic and evolving conversations. By continuously learning and improving over time through access to more data, L\u00fcmbot is fine-tuned for specific tasks, making it more proficient in understanding human-like language. L\u00fcmbot excels in maintaining context in conversation and using backend IT system to complete tasks on behalf of customers. Going beyond standard virtual agents, L\u00fcmbot intelligently adapts personas in real time based on session context, offering a tailored experience for each user. \n Charlene Gavel , SaskTel President and CEO, commented, \"With the introduction of L\u00fcmbot, we are taking a big leap forward in our digital journey, employing generative AI and LLM technology to enable a holistic, end-to-end digital customer service experience.\" \n Sunil Diaz , Alepo CEO, stated: \"Alepo is proud to partner with L\u00fcm Mobile in delivering an AI-driven solution that not only enhances its digital brand but also boosts subscriber growth rates while effectively managing customer acquisition costs.\" \n Generative AI, a promising technology pioneered by OpenAI, Microsoft\u00a0and Alphabet, has seen slower than expected adoption in digital customer service mainly due to the inaccuracy risk inherent with Large Language Models, often referred to as 'hallucinations.' \"Through vertical fine tuning and prompt engineering, we were able to reduce error rates to below human agent levels, while increasing task completion rates, through automated IT system integration. This is the TelcoBot.ai secret sauce\", added Diaz.\u00a0 \n As more vertically specialized Generative AI integrators, like Alepo, are able to solve the hallucination problem the adoption of generative AI customer service is expected to accelerate, disrupting traditional customer service tools and processes. \n The TelcoBot.ai Virtual Agent is able to switch between Customer Service and Sales personas, solve customer problems, answer queries, sell upgrades, provide relevant information for prospects, all while providing an accurate, enjoyable, frustration-free, chat experience. \n \"Digital Customer Engagement is being reinvented by Alepo. The days of rigid chatbots and frustrating IVRs are over.\" concluded Diaz. \n L\u00fcmbot is positioned to drive wireless subscriber take-up rates for L\u00fcm Mobile by delivering an unparalleled digital experience. The AI virtual agent platform aims to make it easier and more enticing for customers to acquire services, ultimately boosting subscriber satisfaction. L\u00fcm Mobile and Alepo look forward to the positive impact L\u00fcmbot will have on customer interactions and anticipate it becoming an integral part of the innovative services provided to subscribers. \n For more details on the L\u00fcmbot project,  see the case study here . \n About SaskTel \n SaskTel is the leading Information and Communications Technology (ICT) provider in  Saskatchewan , with approximately  $1.3 billion  in annual revenue and nearly 1.4 million customer connections including more than 654,000 wireless accesses, 257,000 wireline network accesses, 295,000 internet and data accesses, 111,000 maxTV service subscribers, and 77,000 security monitoring customers.

Revenue topped analysts' estimates, as did current-quarter earnings guidance. \n\n Elsewhere, Microsoft rose more than 1%, sending its market value above the  $3-trillion  level for the first time. The software stock joins Apple as the only two companies with a total market cap above that size. \n\n Both gains added to mega-cap tech's strong performance in 2024, which have propelled the S&P 500 to record highs and confirmed a new bull market. Communication services and information technology stocks boosted the broad index on Wednesday, with both sectors up more than 1%. \n\n Beyond technology, AT&T slipped more than 2% on lower-than-expected earnings. Dupont De Nemours tumbled more than 11% after preannouncing weak fourth-quarter results and issuing disappointing first-quarter guidance. \n\n Earnings reports will remain a focus of traders, with Tesla, Las Vegas Sands and IBM due after the bell. Of the more than 16% of S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly financials thus far in the earnings season, over 71% have surpassed  Wall Street  expectations. \n\n On the economic front, traders will be looking toward data on fourth quarter gross domestic product and the closely watched personal consumption expenditures price index expected later in the week. \n\n Prices for the 10-year  Treasury  sagged, raising yields to 4.15% from Tuesday's 4.14%.   Treasury  prices and yields move in opposite directions. \n\n Oil prices regained  $1.34  to  $75.71   U.S.  a barrel. \n\n Gold prices dropped  $10.60  to  $2,015.20 ."

The  Mortgage Bankers Association  reported a 9.9% weekly increase in mortgage applications. Purchase applications lifted volumes. However, the mortgage rate decline and a small increase in inventory levels are the two positive catalysts.  Watch Toll Brothers  (TOL), whose stock price may have peaked at nearly  $105 . D.R.

Additionally, Microsoft will use Vodafone's fixed and mobile connectivity services. \n Microsoft also intends to invest in Vodafone's managed IoT connectivity platform, which will become a separate, standalone business by  April 2024 . The new company will attract new partners and customers, driving growth in applications and expanding the platform to connect more devices, vehicles and machines. \n The digital services generated by the new partnership will use the latest generative AI technology to provide a highly personalized and differentiated customer experience across multiple channels. They will be built on unbiased and ethical privacy and security policies under Vodafone's established framework for responsible AI. \u00a0 \n Margherita Della Valle , Vodafone Group chief executive, said: \"Today, Vodafone has made a bold commitment to the digital future of  Europe  and  Africa . This unique strategic partnership with Microsoft will accelerate the digital transformation of our business customers, particularly small and medium-sized companies, and step up the quality of customer experience for consumers.\" \n \"This new generation of AI will unlock massive new opportunities for every organization and every industry around the world,\" said  Satya Nadella , chairman and CEO, Microsoft. \"We are delighted that together with Vodafone we will apply the latest cloud and AI technology to enhance the customer experience of hundreds of millions of people and businesses across  Africa  and  Europe , build new products and services, and accelerate the company's transition to the cloud.\" \n The companies have identified five key areas of collaboration: \u00a0 \n Generative AI:  To increase customer satisfaction, the companies will apply the power of Microsoft Azure OpenAI to deliver frictionless, real-time, proactive and hyperpersonalized experiences across all Vodafone customer touchpoints, including its digital assistant TOBi (available in 13 countries). Vodafone employees will also be able to leverage the AI capabilities of Microsoft Copilot to transform working practices, boost productivity and improve digital efficiency. Scaling IoT:  Microsoft intends to invest in Vodafone's new, standalone global Internet of Things (IoT)-managed connectivity platform, which connects 175 million devices and platforms worldwide. Vodafone also plans to become part of the Azure ecosystem making the IoT platform available to a vast developer and third-party community using open APIs. Africa  digital acceleration:  Microsoft intends to help further scale M-Pesa, already the largest financial technology platform in  Africa , by housing it on Azure and enabling the launch of new cloud-native applications. The companies are also launching a purpose-led program that seeks to enrich the lives of 100 million consumers and 1 million SMEs across the African continent. The goal is to enhance digital literacy, skilling and youth outreach programs, as well as offer digital services to the underserved SME market. The partnership aims to boost financial services innovation, building a community of certified developers. Enterprise growth:  Vodafone will extend its commitment to distributing Microsoft services, including Microsoft Azure, security solutions and modern work offerings such as Microsoft Teams Phone Mobile, as part of its strategy to become  Europe's  leading platform for business. This enables business customers to deploy Microsoft's cloud-based services at pace with low adoption and running costs, as well as support the estimated 24 million SMEs across  Europe  through the provision of a managed platform that grows with their business. Cloud transformation:  Vodafone will accelerate its cloud transformation by modernizing its data centers on Microsoft Azure. This will improve its responsiveness to customers, while simplifying and reducing the operational costs of its IT estate. As a result, Vodafone will be able to replace multiple physical data centers with virtual ones across  Europe , simplifying and reducing the operational costs of its IT estate, as well as reducing energy requirements and helping deliver against its sustainable business strategy.

Industry-specific retail data solutions in Microsoft Fabric help retailers unlock insights and lay the foundation for AI. Generative AI solutions help retailers and brands infuse personalization and creativity into marketing campaigns and retail media ad campaigns to capture customer interest and drive revenue opportunities. REDMOND, Wash. ,  Jan. 11, 2024  /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of  NRF 2024: Retail's Big Show ,  Microsoft Corp.  on Thursday announced  new generative AI and data solutions and capabilities for retailers \u00a0that span the retail shopper journey, from enabling personalized shopping experiences, empowering store associates, and unlocking and unifying retail data to helping brands more effectively reach their audiences. Through new copilot templates on Azure OpenAI Service that allow retailers to build personalized shopping experiences and support store operations, the introduction of retail data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, new copilot features in  Microsoft Dynamics  365 Customer Insights, and the launch of  Retail Media Creative Studio  in the Microsoft Retail Media Platform, Microsoft Cloud for Retail now offers more options for retailers to choose from to infuse copilot experiences throughout the shopper journey. \n\n     \n                 \n                         \n                     \n                         \n                 \n\n     \n Retailers globally continue to face challenges across their business \u2014 from high store associate turnover to shifting shopping habits, including the continued rise in omnichannel shopping and a decrease in brand loyalty among consumers, to the growth in siloed data that often holds unrealized value. To address these challenges, retailers are turning to technology and, in the era of AI, they have an opportunity to accelerate its impact with data-backed generative AI solutions to help unlock personalized shopping experiences, enhance store associates' performance and productivity, and uncover insights that ultimately lead to better customer engagement and satisfaction. According to a  Microsoft-commissioned study through IDC , retail organizations are realizing a return on their AI investments within 14 months. 1  Retailers are also seeing an average return of  $3.45  for every  $1  they invest in AI. \n Creating memorable and personalized customer experiences with AI \n Seventy-one percent of consumers  expect companies to deliver personalized interactions ,\u00a0and shoppers with a highly personalized experience are about  twice as likely to add items to their baskets as shoppers without a personalized experience . In an online shopping environment, the tools available to allow shoppers to discover products, provide tailored recommendations and fulfill their shopping needs can be limited, leading to a less than ideal experience. To address this gap, Microsoft Cloud for Retail now offers a  copilot template, in preview, that lets retailers build personalized shopping experiences.  Using a retailer's current systems and data, this prebuilt option can be embedded into existing digital experiences, such as a website or app, making it easier for shoppers to find and purchase the products they want.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n Now, shoppers can benefit from the convenience of online shopping with the experience offered by a personal shopper, just as they would if they were shopping in a physical store. The copilot template allows retailers to build personalized shopping that enable customers to ask for and view products by expressing what they're looking for through natural language. Powered by GPT-4 through Azure OpenAI Service, the technology uses contextual awareness to provide the type of response shoppers would receive from a store associate. For example, a first-time camper shopping for a camping trip to  Yosemite National Park  in early March can visit a sporting goods retailer's website and state in the chat \"I'm going camping in  Yosemite  this March, and I have never camped before. Help me find the right gear.\" Shoppers receive a response in natural language with recommendations for essentials. The copilot template for personalized shopping can also surface complementary items to increase basket size and customer satisfaction. \n \"Generative AI can serve as a key differentiator for retailers, providing their customers with a unique and memorable experience that embodies their brand identity,\" said  Shelley Bransten , corporate vice president, Global Retail,  Consumer Goods & Gaming Industries . \"The new Microsoft Cloud for Retail copilot template for personalized shopping on Azure OpenAI Service is just one of the ways we enable retailers to build copilot experiences. We are committed to democratizing the concierge-like experience across the shopping journey through copilot templates that help retailers create more personalized experiences and reduce time to value.\" \n Innovative retailers, such as  Canadian Tire Corp. (CTC),  are building copilots into the shopping experience to bring additional value to their business and personalize interactions with their customers. Later this spring, CTC is launching an AI shopping assistant, powered by Azure OpenAI Service, to support customers in purchasing certain automotive products. Through generative AI, shoppers can get a better understanding of product options, making the most of their time before and during their in-store visit. \n Empowering store associates with AI tools to improve productivity, job satisfaction and customer experiences \n Store associates are critical to a retailer's success, but the industry continues to face challenges with workforce shortages. Although technology can create transformative impact for retail workers, oftentimes getting it into the hands of store associates can be challenging. Microsoft's  Work Trend Index \u00a0found that 60% of retail frontline workers are excited about the new opportunities that digital tools bring to retail, but 34% feel they don't have the right digital tools or tech to do their job effectively. \n Microsoft is putting generative AI into the hands of store associates and managers, unlocking their potential and contributing to productivity, job satisfaction and, ultimately, customers' shopping experiences. Microsoft Cloud for Retail now provides a  copilot template, in preview, on Azure OpenAI Service, that helps retailers build solutions to support store operations , giving store associates and managers access to insights and information in the flow of work. By accessing the technology on the retailer's mobile devices, tablets or PCs, store associates and managers can use natural language to get answers to questions on store procedures, product catalogs, HR policies and benefits in an efficient and quick way using AI. They can also save time through voice-enabled task creation and assignments, as well as quickly access customer and product information to help them provide quality in-store customer service. \n Applications built with the copilot template can also give store leaders a view into employees' and customers' most frequently asked questions, allowing them to gain insights that help them take meaningful actions, such as updating training, procedures or guidelines. \n Microsoft Experience Centers , with physical store locations in  New York City ,  Sydney  and  London  that offer shoppers the ability to experience Microsoft products and make retail purchases, will be one of the first retailers to implement copilot template for store associates. The technology will give their store associates valuable insights to further enhance shoppers' experiences as they browse products, see demos and learn about Microsoft technology. \n Unlocking insights by unifying retail data and applying AI  \n The retail industry generates 40 petabytes of data every hour. To put it into perspective, that's equivalent to 8 million two-hour long movies, which would require about 1,500 years to binge watch. What's even more surprising is that because data remains siloed, most retailers leverage only a fraction of that data, providing them and their customers with incomplete insights. To derive actionable insights from their data to make the most of AI, seamless integration and standardized data is needed across different systems and applications. \n Today, Microsoft is announcing the preview of new  retail data solutions in  Microsoft Fabric , an end-to-end, unified analytics platform that brings together all the data and analytics tools that organizations need to unlock the potential of their data and lay the foundation for the era of AI. \n Microsoft Fabric gives retailers: \n A data model that allows them to plan, architect and design data solutions. This  retail industry data model  (generally available) can be used for data governance, reporting, business intelligence and advanced analytics. A data connector to bring their e-commerce data from  Sitecore OrderCloud  (preview) into Microsoft Fabric in real time. Under this unified lens, retailers can access insights and tools to proactively improve customer satisfaction and business operations at every touchpoint from storefront to fulfillment. Analytics templates, such as  frequently bought together  (preview), which provides actionable, data-driven recommendations to help retailers improve product upselling and shelf optimization. With the retail data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, organizations can accelerate implementation of retail-specific data models while unifying their data and transforming it into predictive insights that help enhance customer engagement and shopper experiences. \n Infusing generative AI to help retailers and brands deliver successful marketing campaigns and retail media ad campaigns \n Microsoft is  announcing new Copilot features \u00a0in  Dynamics 365 Customer Insights  that will help marketers build end-to-end projects and campaigns. These new features offer marketing teams an AI-first experience to kickstart projects by simply typing in their desired outcome in their own words or by uploading an existing creative brief. Copilot then responds by generating a centralized project board, allowing marketers to manage and update their campaign workflows in one place and get AI-recommended content that can be easily changed \u2014 eliminating the need for siloed applications and saving time. Customers will also have access to Typeface and its enterprise-grade generative AI capabilities to help produce brand-authentic images across assets, supercharging personalized content for greater impact \u2014 all from within Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. Additionally, Typeface helps align content to the organization's brand kit, including themes, fonts and product images \u2014 all extracted from a central asset library. These new Copilot features in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights will be available for early access public preview in the first quarter of 2024.\u00a0 \n Additionally, Microsoft is introducing generative AI to\u00a0the  Microsoft Retail Media platform (powered by   PromoteIQ)  through the launch of  Retail Media Creative Studio ,  a comprehensive, end-to-end banner ad creative solution tailored for retail media, available in preview starting in  January 2024 . With  Retail Media Creative Studio , retailers can empower their advertisers to quickly auto-generate and edit banner creatives by using generative AI. Retailers can then review and approve for use across multiple retail media channels, such as the retailer's owned digital properties and across the open web. The solution optimizes banner campaign performance using AI-powered algorithms and delivers a more personalized shopping experience.  Retail Media Creative Studio  provides more creativity, productivity and revenue opportunities for retailers and advertisers to accelerate the growth of their retail media business. \n Across industries, Microsoft builds unique assets to verticalize the Microsoft Cloud and enable the ecosystem. Through the Microsoft Cloud, retailers can take a tailored approach to bring copilot experiences into the shopper journey. Built on a foundation of trust and  Microsoft's Responsible AI principles , retailers can safely and securely unlock their ability to deliver meaningful shopping experiences and empower every employee to provide exceptional service that turns repeat customers into loyal fans. We invite you to visit the  Microsoft booth (#4503) at NRF 2024: Retail's Big Show \u00a0to learn more about these new solutions and capabilities. \n Microsoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) enables digital transformation for the era of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge.

Indeed, AI boasts incredibly broad applications, which is why there is so much excitement over its development. Today, I want to explore how and why one of the world\u2019s premier retailers is looking to bolster its operations through the development of AI. \n Walmart  is a retail giant that was born in  Bentonville, Arkansas . The retailer now has over 10,000 locations in  North America  and around the world as of  October 31, 2022 . Shares of this retail giant have increased 6.6% month-over-month as of close on  Wednesday, January 10 . Meanwhile, the stock is now up 10% in the year-over-year period. \n How does  Walmart  aim to employ AI going forward?  Walmart  held a keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in  Las Vegas, Nevada  for the first time in its history.  Walmart  CEO  Doug McMillon , a handful of executives, and Microsoft CEO  Satya Nadella . Ultimately, the keynote promised consumers a much faster, more convenient time shopping at  Walmart  and Sam\u2019s Club. \n On the AI side,  Walmart  has said that it is looking to implement it in everything. That will include its supply chain and its application. Moreover, the company aims to implement Drone Delivery at Sam\u2019s Club.  Walmart  has already made 20,000 drone deliveries in the past two years. However, it aims to put this program into hyperdrive in the  Dallas-Fort Worth  area. The company is now offering drone delivery for up to 75% of the  Dallas-Fort Worth  population. \n Meanwhile, through its partnership with Microsoft,  Walmart  has said that it is revamping its generative AI usage. That means improvement to its ChatGPT application as well as GenAi. GenAi, which was recently launched as a search experience on the Apple store, allows customers to partake in customized searches to better meet their needs. \n Walmart\u2019s foray into AI will be well worth monitoring in the months and years ahead. Meanwhile, its stock still boasts solid value and offers a little bit of income with a modest quarterly dividend at the time of this writing."

Investors are still buying AI stock. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is a better choice than Nvidia, based on valuation. \n On the S&P 500, avoid Lumen Technologies (LUMN), the worst performing stock.

This is sharply higher than November\u2019s 103,000 reading. Analysts expected 115,000 job additions in December. The 30-year  Treasury  bond price fell to around  $97 .

            "articleText": "News Direct Adapts to the Changing Landscape of News Distribution \n \n\n News Direct \n\n \n\n \n --News Direct-- In response to the evolving dynamics in the news industry,  News Direct , an innovative, key player in the newswire business, is taking proactive steps to redefine its role in the world of news distribution. The recent trend of major online publishers reducing their focus on news content has spurred News Direct to diversify its product offerings and amplify its digital presence. An  October 19th   New York Times  article, co-authored by  Mike Isaac ,  Katie Robertson , and  Nico Grant , highlighted the concerning shift in the online publishing industry. Leading platforms like Facebook, X, Instagram, and  Google  are minimizing their support for news content. This trend not only affects the media landscape but also has profound implications for the public relations (PR) profession. News Direct occupies a unique position at the intersection between news and PR. It has observed the gradual diminishing effectiveness of traditional news releases in gaining earned media coverage, causing the focus to shift towards the posting of news releases on online platforms like Yahoo! Finance, social media channels like X (formerly known as Twitter) and harnessing the power of SEO. In response to these changes, News Direct is embarking on an intentional effort to diversify its product mix. In addition to pushing out content across its global network, the company is now focused on content amplification by becoming both a distributor of, and a destination for, such content. The primary catalyst for this shift is the dramatic surge in domain authority and organic traffic to  newsdirect.com . Two key factors have contributed to this rise to Internet prominence. First, News Direct introduced \" Digital Asset Direct \", a feature unique in the industry, allowing the distribution of standalone multimedia content over its newswire without the requirement of embedding it within a text-based news release. Such digital content, particularly video, aligns with  Google 's preference for multimedia, further enhancing the News Direct platform's performance in search results. Secondly, News Direct launched its Sponsored Content product,  Town Square , which has seen thousands of sponsored articles published on the website. This has driven a substantial increase in organic traffic, organic keywords, and backlinks, significantly boosting domain ranking and authority. The success of these strategies has encouraged News Direct to expand its product suite to include podcasting ( News Direct Podcast Channel ), guest blogs ( Blog Buffet ), and soon, video/webinars. These offerings enable clients to leverage News Direct's website popularity and employ multiple influential formats to attract and engage audiences. Notably, News Direct posts this content but does not host it, ensuring that visitors are directed to the issuer's preferred site, such as YouTube. This approach provides a symbiotic relationship, whereby News Direct's web traffic benefits content creators, and in turn, that traffic is driven to the content creators' preferred hosting domains. The visitor universe of News Direct's website is diverse, attracting audiences from the PR, IR, and marketing communities, individual and institutional investors, journalists, consumers, and more. Thus, the digital environment acts as a melting pot, catering to various segments of society on a global scale. According to News Direct founder and CEO,  Gregg Castano , \"We at News Direct recognize that the challenges in the news distribution landscape present opportunities for innovation. To quote  Winston Churchill , 'A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.' The dramatic pivot by online publishers most definitely will create obstacles for the PR profession, but we're optimistic that effective use of technology will provide viable alternatives for content amplification. While this is not the sole solution, News Direct is confident that it is a valuable option.\" Contact Details I Gregg Castano +1 203-935-8103 gregg.castano@newsdirect.com View source version on  newsdirect.com :  https://newsdirect.com/news/news-direct-adapts-to-the-changing-landscape-of-news-distribution-733043441"

            "description": "January 25, 2024\u2014 Ever since ChatGPT burst onto the scene in the fall of 2022, generative AI solutions have continued to disrupt industries with their surprising and never-before-seen features. Many of the generative AI solutions we hear about today are based on large language models, which allow them to successfully communicate with end users.",
            "articleText": "The best generative AI solutions of 2024 \n Taking a look at the large language models currently making waves in the AI industry \n \n\n News Direct \n\n \n\n \n --News Direct-- January 25, 2024  \u2014 Ever since ChatGPT burst onto the scene in the  fall of 2022 , generative AI (GenAI) solutions have continued to disrupt industries with their surprising and never-before-seen features.   Many of the generative AI solutions we hear about today are based on large language models (LLM), which allow them to successfully communicate with end users. Every such model has to be pre-trained on vast amounts of data and then fine-tuned using a variety of different methods. As we\u2019re approaching the end of January, let\u2019s look at the list of the most noteworthy of these models and explore the generative AI solutions they power. Compiled by the  AIport newsletter  team, this list is by no means exhaustive, but it is a review of what we believe are the LLM-based generative AI solutions and tools that are likely to make headlines this year. GPT (OpenAI and Microsoft) Expectedly, the first LLM on our list with some of the highest expectations this year is at the core of  ChatGPT  from OpenAI. GPT wasn\u2019t the first LLM out there (there had been others like  BERT ), but it was certainly the first one that resulted in a market-ready GenAI product. The original GPT model (Generative Pretrained Transformers) had 170 billion parameters, while the latest version, GPT-4, boasts over 1.75 trillion. The model\u2019s applications are far and wide, being the basis not only for ChatGPT, but also Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat, which is now part of the  Copilot infrastructure . While ChatGPT remains arguably the most impressive  text-producing  GenAI tool, Bing Chat (unlike ChatGPT) has internet access, making it ideal for  web browsing . In addition, the same core GPT model is being utilized by other entities \u2014 from  Panasonic Connect  in  Japan ,  OCBC Bank\u2019s ChatGPT  in  Singapore , and  KPMG\u2019s KaiChat  in  Germany  to the  UK  government\u2019s upcoming  GOV.UK chat . Notably, GPT is also a vital part of OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E suite \u2014 a solution that generates images based on descriptions from text.  PaLM and Gemini ( Google ) The next one on our list is Google\u2019s PaLM (Pathways Language Model). The model, boasting 540 billion parameters, was first successfully tested in the  spring of 2022 . A year later,  PaLM 2  was announced and subsequently integrated into Bard \u2014 Google\u2019s GenAI chatbot \u2014 becoming available to test users around the world. Bard is considered among the finest solutions for productivity, having internet access like Bing Chat, but being less about navigating the web and more about  answering burning questions .  Bard was  seriously bolstered  at the end of last year with Google\u2019s  highly anticipated launch  of the multimodal LLM, Gemini, which had been trained on  images and audio/video files , not just text. The jury is still out on how far this update will take Bard, but the expectations are very high indeed. LLaMA (Meta, Microsoft, and Hugging Face) LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) from Meta was released in  February last year . However, the 65-billion-parameter model  was leaked online  as a downloadable torrent only a week later.  While the model did not lead to any ChatGPT-like products at Meta, another AI company \u2014 Hugging Face \u2014 picked it up and released  Hugging Chat . Offering internet access, this GenAI solution has been praised as \u201cthe first open source alternative to ChatGPT\u201d with a  snarky sense of humor .  Not to be outdone, Meta  partnered with Microsoft  to produce LLaMA 2 in July of last year. Following that, the company  announced a beta release  of Meta AI at the end of September \u2014 a GenAI chatbot, currently available in the US, that can \u201cprovide real-time information and generate photorealistic images\u201d from text prompts. This solution is expected to reach Meta users across the rest of the globe later in the year. Claude (Anthropic) Our next LLM is made by Anthropic, and it\u2019s named Claude. Founded in 2021, the company along with its language model may be a less familiar name to most non-geeks. But this is likely to change in 2024. That\u2019s the case not only because the latest version of the namesake GenAI chatbot  released last year  can now process long PDF files of  up to 75,000 words , taking moments to summarize  entire books . But also because this has already  caught the attention  of both  Google  and Amazon who are keen to invest  $2  and  $4 billion  respectively. While Claude doesn\u2019t offer internet access, its processing power, namely input character memory, outpowers every competitor by a wide margin, including ChatGPT. And the company is said to be working on yet more handy features as we speak. HyperCLOVA X (Naver) HyperCLOVA X is both the LLM and the namesake GenAI chatbot released by the South Korean search engine giant,  Naver , last August. Boasting over 200 billion parameters, the LLM is being used mainly for  AI-assisted web browsing , much like Bing Chat. While HyperCLOVA X doesn\u2019t speak English, the chatbot\u2019s proficiency in Korean is impressive, having learned  6,500 more Korean words  than ChatGPT.  In addition to answering user queries, HyperCLOVA X has been designed to offer AI  assistance to businesses  across numerous sectors \u2014 from finance to gaming. Naver is also presently working to make HyperCLOVA X multimodal, following in the footsteps of Google\u2019s Gemini, so another big international headline is likely on the way. Pangu (Huawei) Last spring, Huawei, one of the global tech leaders,  unveiled Pangu  \u2014 an LLM with 1.085 trillion parameters in over 40 natural and programming languages. This LLM now powers the Chinese company\u2019s GenAI assistant called Celia, which resides within Huawei\u2019s HarmonyOS 4 operating system. Supposedly, Celia has already outperformed both  Siri and  Google  Assistant  as a phone-based virtual assistant in terms of  prompt execution accuracy , such as finding specific photos and documents stored on a device. And as more Huawei smartphones are being churned out, Celia is expected to reach more global users this year with further refinements to the Pangu model.  In addition, Pangu is available through  Huawei Cloud  for commercial use. According to a  statement  from the company\u2019s leadership, the newest Pangu 3.0 utilizes hierarchical architecture, allowing it to be quickly fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream applications (including Huawei\u2019s  autonomous vehicle solutions ), which we\u2019ll surely see more of in 2024. MiLM-6B ( Xiaomi ) Next up is another Chinese company,  Xiaomi  \u2014 one of the largest phone manufacturers in the world. The company  made an entry  into the LLM race last summer with its MiLM-6B, a lightweight model created for mobile devices. Boasting 6.4 billion parameters, MiLM-6B has reportedly outperformed rivals in its category and achieved notable scores from evaluation platforms like C-Eval and CMMLU.  Xiaomi\u2019s leadership has been vocal for some time about integrating LLMs into its smartphones. It appears that the company\u2019s virtual assistant, Xiao AI, has now finally become a  fully fledged GenAI chatbot , generating over 11 words per second. By this metric, despite operating locally on the phone, Xiao AI has matched the performance of some LLMs running on cloud computing services.  It\u2019ll be interesting to see whether Xiao AI gets assimilated into the company\u2019s other products, as the rumors suggest, including the recently announced  Xiaomi SU7 , an autonomous-enabled electric sedan. YandexGPT ( Yandex ) The final entry on our list is an LLM named  YandexGPT  from the Russian search engine  Yandex . The namesake GenAI solution with 100 billion parameters was beta-released in May last year. The more recent  release of YandexGPT2  has demonstrated a 65% improvement in response quality, with a 1.5-fold increase in training data. Interestingly, this GenAI solution was tested and  scored enough points  to enter a Russian university.  YandexGPT was also integrated into Yandex\u2019s flagship virtual assistant named  Alice , as well as the company\u2019s  smart speakers . Furthermore, the LLM has allowed the company\u2019s e-shoppers to view  summarized customer reviews  in one place. With YandexGPT at the core, the company now also offers visual GenAI solutions,  YandexART and Shedevrum , that can generate images from text, much like Open AI\u2019s DALL-E. Currently, the LLM is also being merged with  Yandex  Search to offer the end user something similar to Bing Chat and HyperCLOVA X. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll see a new announcement pertaining to this development later in the year. New kids on the block Apart from the above entries on our list, several brand new LLMs along with their GenAI solutions are expected to arrive any day from other big players. Among them are  Samsung  from  South Korea ,  Tencent  from  China , as well as Amazon and Apple.  In fact, Apple already has an  internal AI chatbot  for employees, but its much-talked-about  AppleGPT  based on the company\u2019s LLM,  Ajax , is said to be around the corner. Amazon began to offer a service for  building AI chatbots  called Lex a while ago, but more notably, the company recently announced its upcoming  GenAI solution  tailored for commercial use.  Japan  doesn\u2019t intend to be left behind either \u2014 at least three major LLM initiatives are currently being played out. Among them is a  joint project  between Fujitsu, RIKEN, Tokyo Tech, and  Tohoku University  who are developing a series of LLMs using one of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers,  Fugaku . In addition, both  NTT  and  SoftBank  are reportedly in the final stages of developing their \u201chomegrown\u201d LLMs. While much remains unclear and covered in mist (or is it gray goo \ud83d\ude09), one thing is certain \u2014 2024 is going to be the most AI-intense year we have seen yet!

AUSTIN, Texas ,  Jan. 25, 2024  /PRNewswire/ -- Alepo proudly announces that L\u00fcm Mobile, SaskTel's innovative all-digital mobile brand, has launched L\u00fcmbot, a cutting-edge AI-powered virtual agent from Alepo to deliver an all-digital customer support experience. \n\n     \n                 \n                         \n                     \n                         \n                 \n\n     \n L\u00fcmbot, which lives on L\u00fcm Mobile's website, harnesses the power of Generative AI to provide subscribers with an unparalleled level of interaction. Unlike traditional chatbots constrained by preset rules, Alepo's AI Virtual Agent is able to comprehend and engage in human-like customer service sessions through the use of Large Language Model (LLM). The AI Virtual Agent understands nuanced subscriber interaction and offers a high task completion rate, measured by a drastic reduction in escalations to human agents since it was soft launched late last year. \n L\u00fcmbot is designed to handle a wide range of inputs and can understand context, resulting in dynamic and evolving conversations. By continuously learning and improving over time through access to more data, L\u00fcmbot is fine-tuned for specific tasks, making it more proficient in understanding human-like language. L\u00fcmbot excels in maintaining context in conversation and using backend IT system to complete tasks on behalf of customers. Going beyond standard virtual agents, L\u00fcmbot intelligently adapts personas in real time based on session context, offering a tailored experience for each user. \n Charlene Gavel , SaskTel President and CEO, commented, \"With the introduction of L\u00fcmbot, we are taking a big leap forward in our digital journey, employing generative AI and LLM technology to enable a holistic, end-to-end digital customer service experience.\" \n Sunil Diaz , Alepo CEO, stated: \"Alepo is proud to partner with L\u00fcm Mobile in delivering an AI-driven solution that not only enhances its digital brand but also boosts subscriber growth rates while effectively managing customer acquisition costs.\" \n Generative AI, a promising technology pioneered by OpenAI, Microsoft\u00a0and Alphabet, has seen slower than expected adoption in digital customer service mainly due to the inaccuracy risk inherent with Large Language Models, often referred to as 'hallucinations.' \"Through vertical fine tuning and prompt engineering, we were able to reduce error rates to below human agent levels, while increasing task completion rates, through automated IT system integration. This is the TelcoBot.ai secret sauce\", added Diaz.\u00a0 \n As more vertically specialized Generative AI integrators, like Alepo, are able to solve the hallucination problem the adoption of generative AI customer service is expected to accelerate, disrupting traditional customer service tools and processes. \n The TelcoBot.ai Virtual Agent is able to switch between Customer Service and Sales personas, solve customer problems, answer queries, sell upgrades, provide relevant information for prospects, all while providing an accurate, enjoyable, frustration-free, chat experience. \n \"Digital Customer Engagement is being reinvented by Alepo. The days of rigid chatbots and frustrating IVRs are over.\" concluded Diaz. \n L\u00fcmbot is positioned to drive wireless subscriber take-up rates for L\u00fcm Mobile by delivering an unparalleled digital experience. The AI virtual agent platform aims to make it easier and more enticing for customers to acquire services, ultimately boosting subscriber satisfaction. L\u00fcm Mobile and Alepo look forward to the positive impact L\u00fcmbot will have on customer interactions and anticipate it becoming an integral part of the innovative services provided to subscribers. \n For more details on the L\u00fcmbot project,  see the case study here . \n About SaskTel \n SaskTel is the leading Information and Communications Technology (ICT) provider in  Saskatchewan , with approximately  $1.3 billion  in annual revenue and nearly 1.4 million customer connections including more than 654,000 wireless accesses, 257,000 wireline network accesses, 295,000 internet and data accesses, 111,000 maxTV service subscribers, and 77,000 security monitoring customers.

            "description": "Interested in investing in HiveSkill\u2019 s campaign? Click here to get started.. Outside of hiring a marketing firm to handle marketing campaigns, companies of all sizes are largely dependent on Meta ads, Google ads and Amazon ads.",
            "articleText": "A More Personalized Approach To Digital Marketing: How HiveSkill Is Revolutionizing The Industry \n \n\n News Direct \n\n \n\n \n --News Direct-- By  Faith Ashmore , Benzinga Interested in investing in HiveSkill\u2019s campaign?  Click here to get started . The world of digital marketing could be in for another evolution with a new direct marketing company,  HiveSkill . HiveSkill offers a unique marketing solution characterized by customization, hyper-targeting and a foundation of trust and data. Its approach involves delivering context-driven marketing campaigns tailored to pre-qualified leads sourced from its industry-leading consumer database \u2013 with the goal of enabling more efficient marketing.  Powered by advanced artificial intelligence, HiveSkill conducts thorough audience profiling, categorizing contacts into relevant interest groups or \"buckets.\" This enables them to craft the optimal audience for effectively conveying a company's story and messaging. By leveraging its extensive resources and cutting-edge technology, HiveSkill ensures that each marketing campaign is highly personalized and precisely targeted to maximize engagement and conversion rates.  This unique approach differs from the current options on the market. Outside of hiring a marketing firm to handle marketing campaigns, companies of all sizes are largely dependent on  Meta  ads (NASDAQ: META),  Google  ads (NASDAQ: GOOG) and  Amazon  ads (NASDAQ: AMZN). While these big tech platforms have the potential to drive leads, they are complicated and costly, and the majority of users don\u2019t have the experience to operate them effectively.  According to a survey by Wharton , even professionals are not able to make the most of these platforms; 57% of marketers incorrectly interpret their data, potentially costing their companies significant amounts of money. Not to mention, big tech companies have so much information that it can be difficult to narrow down to an audience that matches your marketing goals. Let\u2019s say you are a school supply company and your target audience is parents of elementary school children.  Amazon , Meta and  Google  may be able to drive traffic from parents of any children from pre-school through 12th grade, but in doing so, your company is targeting too many people and spending unnecessary money on leads that won\u2019t convert. Today\u2019s digital marketing is only a few steps above cold calling and emailing. While there is data available to help personalize ads and improve targeting, most companies don\u2019t have access to that data or the means to utilize it.  That\u2019s why HiveSkill\u2019s use of  emotionally intelligent AI  is potentially groundbreaking for the industry. Hiveskill\u2019s platform was built by leveraging a comprehensive database and has been meticulously constructed through entrepreneurial networks and partnerships. With seamless integration thanks to  Hubspot  and a host of other marketing systems, companies can have more trust in their marketing approach. With the big tech marketing alternatives, it can sometimes feel like you\u2019re just one drop in an ocean; HiveSkill aims to solve this.  When businesses choose to partner with HiveSkill, they not only benefit from the existing database and tools, but HiveSkill will also use existing infrastructure to help build a unique \u201cHive\u201d of engaged prospects, creating a mutually beneficial feedback loop of data. As a result, HiveSkill's database has evolved into a robust engine consisting of millions of curated and profiled contacts. With HiveSkill, companies can confidently execute marketing campaigns with the assurance that they have access to accurate and valuable data, enabling them to effectively engage and connect with their target and \u201clook-alike\u201d audiences. According to  Criteo , a staggering 1 in 3 marketers admit that their campaigns rely too heavily on platforms like Facebook,  Google  and  Amazon . With growing concerns and uncertainties surrounding the future of these big tech giants, marketers who are seeking a more efficient and personalized alternative can leverage HiveSkill as the solution.

            "articleText": "These Are the Stocks With Big Moves Today \n \n\n Baystreet.ca \n\n \n\n \n \n The S&P 500\u2019s (SPY) tentative rally to all-time highs is outshining China\u2019s CSI 300 Index at multi-year lows. Again, markets benefited from the technology stock strength. Just as AMD (AMD) and  PayPal  (PYPL) attracted the most trading yesterday, it will do so again today. Potentially hurt by stretched valuations, AMD stock might fall as profit-takers lock their gains. \n On the index, most of the technology stocks traded at new highs on Monday. Alphabet (GOOG), Applied Materials (AMAT), Salesforce (CRM),  Palo Alto  (PANW), Western Digital (WDC), Micron (MU), Akamai (AKAM), Arista (ANET), and Broadcom (AVGO) are the stocks that could move big again today. \n Left behind in this historic rally are the small caps. Expect the ETF (IWM) to show volatility today. The sector has the greatest burden of higher borrowing costs from rising rates. Inflation hurts demand, weakening revenue for small companies. Their bottom line shrinks, raising the risk of bankruptcy. \n Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is the top holding on the Russell 2000 ETF. The supercomputer firm soared last week after raising its dividend. Watch out for selling pressure on AI-related stocks, which would hurt small caps. In addition, Rambus (RMBS) and Onto Innovation (ONTO) are also tech stocks in the top holdings on IWM. Any weakness in tech stocks would hurt those firms, too. \n Tourism cruise ship firm Carnival (CCL) potentially peaked at over  $19  last month. It risks breaking below the 50-day and 200-day simple moving average after that."

The broader market owes the rally to the Nasdaq Composite Index, which gained 1.70% on the day. \n Apple  (AAPL) is the stock to watch. The iPhone giant launched an expensive  Apple  Vision Pro. Unfortunately, major firms are snubbing the headset. Alphabet\u2019s (GOOG) YouTube,  Spotify  (SPOT), and  Netflix  (NFLX) are not supporting apps for it. \n Apple  needs broad app support to gain appeal. Without it, consumers are unlikely to pay the premium price when it has limited use. It forces  Apple  to develop custom VR-ready applications at a considerable expense. \n Multiples Expand \n The S&P 500\u2019s rally expanded the price-to-earnings multiples. It increases the risk of stretched valuations leading to a correction. The market rally is dependent on excessively bullish sentiment. Value investors may pivot to cheaper stocks to hedge their bets. However, this strategy may not work well.  \n As long as investors avoid the inexpensive  China  technology stocks, they should avoid losses should markets lose momentum.  China  tech stocks are cheap because the country is in a steepening recession. The less followed stocks like  Joyy Inc.

            "articleText": "Artificial Intelligence: OurCrowd\u2019s 20 Verticals For Investors To Watch \n \n\n News Direct \n\n \n\n \n --News Direct--   AI seems to be the world\u2019s fastest-growing investment sector. The rush of interest in ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms has triggered a global wave of funding for the new technology. \u201cArtificial intelligence may be one of the biggest technological leaps in history. It is poised to unlock new business models, transform industries, reshape people\u2019s jobs, and boost economic productivity,\u201d  Goldman Sachs  says in a special report. The AI and machine learning market reached  $197.5 billion  in end-user spending in 2022 according to PitchBook. Generative AI will become a  $1.3 trillion  market by 2032, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 42%, says Bloomberg Intelligence. Investors need to take a vertical view of the AI revolution. The application of AI to each business vertical will transform our world and shape the economies of the future. AI is poised to affect every industry sector, with an impact comparable to the introduction of computerization and, before that, electricity. \u201cGenerative AI has the potential to change the world, but you need to be in it for the long haul,\u201d  Gary Munitz , Executive Director at  Australia -based  Macquarie Capital , told PitchBook at the 2023  OurCrowd  Global Investor Summit. \u201cIf you understand the real-world use cases, then it\u2019s worth investing in \u2013 but if you just think the tech is cool, then it\u2019s not for you. It could be years until we see outcomes, and investors will need to be patient.\u201d OurCrowd\u2019s  portfolio includes  One AI , a generative AI platform that empowers businesses to rapidly deploy the world\u2019s leading AI capabilities in their own products and services. The use of AI will differ depending on the application. To understand the future of AI as investors and how to deploy capital most effectively, we need to consider each of these verticals and not just the horizontal impact of AI across the board. We are already seeing the successful deployment of AI technology in those sectors where the light-speed analysis of vast amounts of data can help produce rapid, automated solutions that previously would have been impossible to achieve \u2013 or at least taken much longer. OurCrowd  has more than 80 investments \u2013 about 20% of its portfolio \u2013 based on AI technology, and the number is growing. These companies are not just using general AI principles and technologies but are developing specific AI techniques applied to specialist areas. Investors specializing in each of those sectors will be better placed to gauge the impact of AI on those industries and the potential of the startups seeking to disrupt them. The next wave of investment in AI will be in companies applying this new core technology to specific industry verticals that are likely to be revolutionized as a result. There will be huge opportunities for investment in these verticalized plays, which are not yet fully appreciated and are still valued at fractions of their potential. Just this week,  Google  Cloud announced two new AI-powered life sciences solutions to accelerate drug discovery and precision medicine. \u201cThese new solutions launching today can transform life sciences organizations by accelerating drug discovery and bringing therapeutics to market faster,\u201d said  Shweta Maniar , global director, Life Sciences Strategy and Solutions,  Google  Cloud. \u201cWhen patients are waiting for that life-saving treatment in cancer care or that quality-of-life medicine for migraine headaches, this faster time-to-market can have an incredibly positive impact on lives.\u201d OurCrowd\u2019s AI-powered drug discovery company portfolio company CytoReason already has multimillion-dollar contracts with  Pfizer  (NYSE: PFE) and  Sanofi , and it is working with many of the top global pharma companies to develop innovative treatments.

            "articleText": "Locofy.ai's Accelerates Web Design-To-Code with AI as It Pioneers Large Design Models \n \n\n \n Newsfile Corp. \n \n\n Newsfile Corp \n\n \n\n \n Large Design Models, created in-house by Locofy.ai, can be used to turn designs into rich code, saving developer time. Locofy.ai announces the launch of Locofy Lightning, accelerating the design-to-code transformation. \n Singapore ,  Singapore --( Newsfile Corp.  -  January 16, 2024 ) -  Singapore -based tech startup Locofy.ai is revolutionizing the web development industry with the launch of Locofy Lightning, a cutting-edge tool that leverages their proprietary Large Design Models (LDMs) to convert Figma designs into web frontend code with unprecedented speed and efficiency. \n The world continues to face its toughest software developer shortage, prompting a global movement towards AI-coding assistants to tackle the increasing gap. The  International Data Corporation (IDC)  has predicted a global shortfall of 4 million developers by 2025.  The US Labor Department  estimates that the global shortage of software engineers may reach 85.2 million by 2030, resulting in about  $8.5 trillion  in unrealized annual revenues. Between 66% and 90% of US employers struggle to find the skills they need, with tech positions being among the top 10 hardest roles to fill. \n Additionally, research has shown that approximately 80% of software developers suffer from burnout, with high workload cited as the leading cause - further highlighting the need for AI tools to reduce developers' workload. The shortage of developers has led to a sharp 20-30% increase in developer salaries making development costs skyrocket and putting immense pressure on companies with recent research highlighting that 89% of US business decision-makers are concerned about the on-time delivery of software. \n In a significant stride for frontend web development,  Singapore -headquartered  Locofy.ai  has announced the launch of their Large Design Models (LDMs) and a new product, Locofy Lightning, which uses their LDMs to provide a pioneering 1-click technology that converts Figma designs into web frontend code. Leveraging Locofy's Large Design Models (LDMs) built in-house, Locofy Lightning will save developers up to 80% of the time it takes to code the user interface from scratch. \n \n Locofy.ai's accelerates web design-to-code with AI as it pioneers Large Design Models \n To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit: \n https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8814/194331_ae319619b463e865_002full.jpg \n This is where AI-first automated code assistants like Locofy.ai offer a solution to this massive, fast-growing problem, by reducing development cost and time to market. According to a 2023 Stack Overflow Developer survey, 70% of all respondents are using or are planning to use AI tools in their development process this year. \n Speaking about Locofy.ai and its impact,  Cameron Pak , Founder of  USA -based Melos, says: \"I'd say, Locofy is the ChatGPT equivalent for front-end interfaces in terms of ease of use and helpfulness. I think Locofy is positioned to be a game-changer for not only the low-code, no-code movement but also for those who are full-time developers, saving them time and money.\" Similarly,  Mark Zielinski , Chief Technology Officer at  Canada -based Where is My Package said: \"Locofy has saved us countless hours in our design-to-code workflow and helped us work more effectively.\" \n Developers and designers typically spend hundreds of hours turning web designs into production-grade code. A new app or feature can take weeks to design on popular design tools like Figma and AdobeXD, followed by months of frontend and backend development from scratch. With Figma becoming the darling of the design world, Adobe moved in 2022 to acquire the company for  $20 billion  but the merger was mutually abandoned last month. Figma, used by over a million teams to design their apps and web products has become increasingly popular among developers contributing to  30% of its active user base.  As a Figma plugin, Locofy.ai aims to convert Figma designs into code with 1-click and automate close to 80% of the mundane time-consuming parts of frontend development, allowing developers to focus on the more complex business logic and bringing their ideas to market 2-3 times faster and cheaper. \n With just 1-click, Locofy Lightning seamlessly translates Figma designs into plug-and-play code, revolutionizing the way development teams approach their work. At the heart of Locofy Lightning lies a technology stack built in house, particularly the use of Large Design Models (LDMs). Trained on a vast dataset comprising millions of designs, these LDMs dissect visual elements, optimize layouts, and enhance code structure. \n \"Our investment of over  $1M  in the development of Locofy Lightning underscores our dedication to pushing the boundaries of frontend development,\" says  Honey Mittal , Co-Founder & CEO of Locofy.ai. \"This innovation has emerged out of a clear market need. AI is helping to lower the entry barrier to software development, and businesses around the world are looking for AI-driven, automated coding assistants that maintain stringent quality standards. Locofy Lightning is particularly advantageous for fast-moving startups and customer-focused enterprises, as it speeds up frontend development and empowers lean teams to deliver world-class outcomes.\" \n Honey Mittal  concluded: \"Like many first saw the potential of Large Language Models with the advent of chatbots like ChatGPT, at Locofy we provide the complete solution for design-to-code by providing both the foundational Large Design Models and product to make them accessible, Locofy Lightning.\" \n Locofy.ai made its entrance onto the tech scene in 2021. After a  remarkable debut on Product Hunt  with a clean sweep of all 7 awards on offer, and securing a series of investments totaling  $7.5M  from industry luminaries such as the CTO and co-founders of Dropbox, Ola, and esteemed funds like  Accel and Northstar Ventures , Locofy.ai ran its free beta program for close to 2 years coupled with multiple rounds of user feedback. Based on developer feedback, code quality and ease of use emerged as the two topics that developers care about the most, prompting the introduction of Locofy Lightning. \n Locofy Lightning integrates seamlessly into existing workflows, without disrupting established processes. The beta release for Figma to web frontend is available as of  16 January 2024 , with a 1-click solution for mobile apps on the horizon. \n About the company: About Locofy.ai Locofy.ai is a developer tool that accelerates frontend development by converting designs to code. Its low code platform helps developers and designers launch their web and mobile products up to 80% faster.

Bullish investors are about to unwind their chronically bullish outlook after the  U.S.  posted inflation in food and shelter costs in  December 2023 .  \n Interest-sensitive stocks likely peaked from here. Watch out for selling volume in Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) to increase on Friday. \n In the technology sector, job cuts are resuming. The Federal Reserve\u2019s persistently high interest rates are slowing the economy, hurting the advertising business. Demand for innovation and hardware devices continues to weaken. Alphabet (GOOG) said it would cut hundreds of jobs across its engineering and hardware division.\nJob losses at  Google  are a troubling sign. Alphabet is among the magnificent seven that led the stock market\u2019s uptrend that began in  October 2023 . \n Consumers do not need new features in  Google  Assistant, so the firm may cut staff in that division. \n Neither  Apple  (AAPL) nor Microsoft (MSFT) announced any major restructuring yet. If they do, look out below. Growing tech firms cannot increase profits by cutting costs. They need stronger underlying business demand. \n Seasonally, CES 2024 ends at the end of the week. It will mark a top in semiconductor stocks, especially in shares of  Nvidia  (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)."

Last week, autonomous chip supplier Mobileye (MBLY) lost 32% of its value after issuing a warning. \n Last Friday, beat up  REIT Medical Properties Trust  (MPW) lost 30%, closing at prices not seen since 2009 (15 years ago). The firm took steps to recover uncollected rents from its tenant,  Stewart Health Care System , yet granted that same firm a  $60 million  loan. Trade MPW stock today instead of treating it as an income REIT. \n Apple  (AAPL) is about to find support at  $180  on the 200 day simple moving average. Without its leadership this morning, smaller technology stocks by market cap size will struggle to find direction. In the consumer electronics sector, watch Sony (SONY) and retailer Best Buy (BBY). Among the tech companies, watch Microsoft (MSFT), which is about to overtake  Apple  in size. \n Watch for upside moves in Nvidia (NVDA), an AI leader while the more diversified firm, Broadcom (AVGO) fights to hold its upside at  $1,048 . Investors are still buying AI stock. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is a better choice than Nvidia, based on valuation. \n On the S&P 500, avoid Lumen Technologies (LUMN), the worst performing stock. Its CEO is a former Microsoft executive."

It will continue to fight the patent infringement ruling raised by Masimo (MASI). Customers are more than willing to upgrade their iPhones. AAPL stock shows no signs of losing its upward momentum. \n Meta Platforms had a simple strategy of not mentioning its expensive metaverse. Markets bought META stock as the firm increased its buyback. \n Microsoft is a cash cow with its Office 365 product. \n Nvidia  benefits from the  U.S.  restricting exports to  China . It released the \u201cD\u201d version of the 4090 GPU recently. \n Tesla  is the leading EV giant. As it slashes prices, demand increases. \n None of the M7 stocks indicate any weakness at this time.
